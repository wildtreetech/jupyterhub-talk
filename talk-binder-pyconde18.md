Earliest libraries were archives of clay tablets. Appeared in Mesopotamia about 2600BC. Making clay tablets was hard work, as you could imagine. Recording information is something humans have been doing for a very long time. It is a valuable thing to do! Information is power.

Things have changed a bit since then. We invented paper and the printing press.
At first access was restricted, you had to pay or prove you were a real scholar to get access. The ideas of the modern public library only started around 1850 or so.
Now spreading information via books and documents has become easy! We can do this at scale!

# Libraries?

But you hardly ever go there anymore, these days a large part of the work of a library is to broker access to digital information and to curate that information.

# Going beyond paper

.center.width-90[![](img/visual-question-answering.png)]

???

With just the static paper it isn't actually well defined what they did. This
means that we can't reproduce their work because we don't actually know
what it is they did.

---

# Going beyond paper

.center.width-90[![](img/visual-question-answering-code.png)]

???

We need the code and the environment in which that code was run in order
to have a full definition of what it is they did. Now we can start
discussing about reproducing their work.

This means that producing information is basically free now, but successfully consuming it has never been harder. It is very likely that computer programs played a role in generating that information, so you need to have access to them as well as the text itself

# The IT Department Approach

Your IT department tightly controls what can be installed, there are
approved tools that you shall use.

.larger[Crafting a good Dockerfile requires significant expertise.]

These are the six lines you need to install one package:

```
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install --yes --no-install-recommends \
*       less && \
    apt-get purge && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

# repo2docker understands you

It can parse many different files that specify what dependencies to install.
This means that you can keep working the way you have always been working,
and benefit from `repo2docker` from day one.

Supported configuration files:

.left-column[
* `requirements.txt`
* `environment.yml`
* `apt.txt`
* `REQUIRE`
* and more!
]
.right-column[
* `install.R`
* `runtime.txt`
* `postBuild`
* `Dockerfile`
]
]

# Back to sharing

On any machine you can reproduce the environment of the paper:

```
$ repo2docker https://github.com/davidmascharka/tbd-nets
```
Install repo2docker locally with:
```
$ pip install jupyter-repo2docker
```

Can we make it even easier?
